Disaster recovery
-----------------

.. index:: git reflog

``git reflog`` will list all the recent commits, whether they're reachable from
any branch or tag or not.   Find the one you want, check it out by its commit,
and then you can make that a branch with ``git branch <new-name>`` (I think).

Undoing things
--------------

.. index:: git reset, git undo

If you've committed some changes, then for some reason decide you didn't
want to commit them yet - but still want the changes present in your local
working directory - there are several options.

To get rid of the actual ``commit`` but keep all those changes staged::

    $ git reset --soft HEAD~

To get rid of the actual commit and keep the changes, but not staged::

    $ git reset HEAD~

And if you didn't want those changes at all - *WARNING* this will lose
changes - gone::

    $ git reset --hard HEAD~

Fetching
--------

.. index:: git fetch

Update all local remote tracking branches from all remotes::

    git fetch --all

Update all local remote tracking branches from origin::

    git fetch origin

Update/create local branch origin/master from remote origin's branch master with default configuration::

    git fetch origin master

Update/create local branch 'tmp' from remote origin's branch master (but only updates
if fast-forward is possible)::

    get fetch origin master:tmp

Peek at an artitrary remote's branch by pulling it into a (temporary) local branch, then
check its log. The temporary local branch will eventually be garbage collected::

    git fetch git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git maint
    git log FETCH_HEAD


Branches and checkouts
----------------------

.. index:: git checkout, git branch

Check out an existing branch::

    git checkout <branch>

Create new branch::

    git branch <branchname> [<start point>]

Create new branch and check it out in one command::

    git checkout -b <newbranch> [<start point>]


Import one repo into another with history

Cleaning
--------

.. index:: git clean, git remote prune

Delete untracked files (be careful!)::

    git clean -fdx

Prune branches that have been merged and are no longer upstream::

    http://devblog.springest.com/a-script-to-remove-old-git-branches

Prune branches that track remote branches that no longer exist
(http://kparal.wordpress.com/2011/04/15/git-tip-of-the-day-pruning-stale-remote-tracking-branches/)::

    $ git remote prune origin --dry-run
    $ git remote prune origin

Pulls
-----

.. index:: pull request

Easier access to pull requests on Github.  Add to config::

    # This will make pull requests visible in your local repo
    # with branch names like 'origin/pr/NNN'
    # WARNING: This also breaks adding a new remote called "origin" manually
    # because git thinks there already is one.  Comment this out temporarily
    # in that case, unless you can think of a better solution.
    [remote "pulls"]
        fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*

Aliases
-------

Handy aliases for config::

    [alias]
    lg = log --oneline --graph --date-order
    lgd = log --oneline --graph --date-order --format=format:\"%ai %d %s\"

    cb = checkout -b
    cd = checkout develop
    co = checkout

    gd = !git fetch origin && git checkout develop && git pull origin develop
    gm = !git fetch origin && git checkout master && git pull origin master

    # push -u the current branch
    pu = "!CURRENT=$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD) && git push -u origin $CURRENT"

    # push -f
    pf = push -f

    # Find the common ancestor of HEAD and develop and show a diff
    # from that to HEAD
    dd = "!git diff $(git merge-base develop HEAD)"
    # Find the common ancestor of HEAD and master and show a diff
    # from that to HEAD
    dm = "!git diff $(git merge-base master HEAD)"

    # These need 'hub' installed.
    # Create pull request against develop.  Must pass issue number.
    #pr = pull-request -b develop -i
    # Create pull request against develop, not passing issue number:
    pr = pull-request -b develop

    # Checkout pull request
    # Assume origin/pr/NN is pull request NN
    # Need a bash function because we need to concatenate something to $1
    #cpr = "!f() {set -x;git checkout origin/pr/$1; };f"
    cpr = "!gitcpr"

    # Undo any uncommited changes
    abort = checkout -- .

Submodules
----------

.. index:: git submodule

This will typically fix things::

    git submodule update --init --recursive

(and yes, you need --init every time)

Add a new submodule [http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules]
::

    $ git submodule add git@github.com:mozilla/basket-client basket-client

Combining feature branches
--------------------------

.. index:: git rebase

Suppose you have branch A and branch B, which branched off of master
at various times, and you want to create a branch C that contains
the changes from both A & B.

According to Calvin: checkout the first branch, then git checkout -b BRANDNEWBRANCH. then rebase it on the second.

(SEE DIAGRAMS BELOW)

Example::

    # Start from master
    git checkout master
    git pull [--rebase]

    # Create the new branch from tip
    git checkout -b C

    # rebase A on master
    git checkout A
    git rebase -i master
    # merge A into C
    git checkout C
    git merge A

    # rebase B
    git checkout B
    git rebase -i master
    # merge B into C
    git checkout C
    git merge B

    # I think???
    # Review before using, and verify the result

Combining git branches diagrams

Start::

    o - o - o - o <--- master
     \   \
      \   o - o - o  <--- A
       o - o - o <--- B

Rebase A on master::

                     master
                     /
    o - o - o - o - o - o - o <--- A
     \
      o - o - o <--- B

Create new branch N from master::

                    master
                     /
    o - o - o - o - o - o - o <--- A
     \               \
      \               N
       \
        o - o - o <--- B

Switch to N and merge A::

                    master
                     /
    o - o - o - o - o - o - o <--- A
     \               \
      \               o - o - o  <--- N  (includes A)
       \
        o - o - o <--- B

Rebase B on master::

                    master
                     /
    o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o <--- A
                    |\
                    |  o - o - o <--- N (includes A)
                    \
                      o - o - o  <--- B

On N, merge B::

                    master
                    /
    o - o - o - o - o - o - o - o <--- A
                    |\
                    | o - o - o -  o - o - o <--- N (includes A and B)
                    \
                     o - o - o  <--- B

Delete A and B if desired.
