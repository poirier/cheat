JIRA
====

Preface: the JIRA documentation is among the worst I have *ever* seen.

Filters
-------

Filters and subscriptions can help you deal with JIRA by notifying you
when specific things happen.

This is twisted, but the only way to *create* a filter is to first do
a search, and then save it. There is no "create a filter" or "add a filter"
anywhere in the interface.

Subscriptions
-------------

A subscription is basically a cron job for JIRA to search using a saved
filter and email you the results, optionally only if there are results.

Start by going to the filters list and finding the filter you want to
use in your subscription. Then click the "..." at the right end of that
line and select "manage subscriptions".

I *think* it's self-explanatory from there.
