My i3 bindings

"Ŵ" is the "windows" key

Change what we see::

    Ŵ-<NUMBER>: switch to workspace NUMBER on whatever monitor it's
                attached to.
    Ŵ-Control-1: Only use built-in laptop display
    Ŵ-Control-2: Use built-in laptop display, and external display
                 positioned to its left
    Ŵ-<n>:    Switch to workspace <n> (need not already exist)
              (if workspace <n> is on another screen, it'll switch
              that screen to workspace <n>, not your current screen)
    Ŵ-<n> where <n> is the current workspace: Switch back to previous
              workspace (So you can just do Ŵ-1 (look at screen) Ŵ-1
              and be back where you started)

Focus::

    Ŵ-j, Ŵ-<left>   left
    Ŵ-k, Ŵ-<down>   down
    Ŵ-l, Ŵ-<up>     up
    Ŵ-;, Ŵ-<right>  right

Move things::

    Ŵ-Control-<ARROW>: Move current workspace to another monitor.
    Ŵ-Shift-Number: Move current window to another workspace
           (need not already exist)
    Shift-<FOCUS COMMAND>: Move current window within workspace

Layouts::

    Ŵ-e             default (splith/splitv), repeat to toggle
                    splith/splitv
    Ŵ-s             stacked
    Ŵ-w             tabbed
    Ŵ-f             fullscreen (toggle)
    Ŵ-S-<spc>       float  (toggle)
    Ŵ-mouse1-drag   move floating

    Ŵ-h             Make the current window/container a horizontal
                    split container. New windows opened when this
                    container is focused will be created
                    by splitting this container horizontally
                    (side-by-side)
    Ŵ-v             Like Ŵ-h, but vertical (one above another)

    Ŵ-e             toggle between defaulting to horizontal and
                    defaulting to vertical

Start/end things::

    Ŵ-return: open new terminal
    Ŵ-D: open dmenu at top to enter a command (output invisible,
         use to start new graphical programs)
    Ŵ-S-q       kill window

Control I3::

    Ŵ-S-c       reload I3 config
    Ŵ-S-r       restart I3
    Ŵ-S-e       kill I3 (logout)

Resizing::

    Ŵ-mouse2-drag  stretch or shrink window

Screen capture::

    <Printscreen> - capture whole screen
    Shift-<Printscreen> - select a rectangle or window (?)
    Control-<Printscreen> - capture currently focused window
