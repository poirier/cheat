Optimizing Django queries on big data
=====================================

Suppose you have a query that needs to run against a table
or tables with many millions of rows. Maybe you need to operate
on a couple million of them.  What are the do's and don't's of a
Django query that will not pessimize performance (time and memory use)?

* Don't bother with .iterator(), it downloads the whole result and then
  iterates over it. It does not do what many of us think/thought it did
  (use a database cursor to pull down the results only as you work through them)
* Do limit the query ([start:end]) and run it repeatedly in reasonable
  sized batches, to avoid downloading too big a chunk
* Do use .only() and its kin to minimize how much of each record is downloaded to what you need
* Do not order_by() unless you must - it forces the DB to collect the
  results of the whole query first so it can sort them, even if you then limit the results you retrieve
* Same for .distinct().

The model that a queryset is over
=================================

    queryset.model

Combining querysets
====================

Given two querysets over the same model, you can do things like this::

    queryset = queryset1 & queryset2
    queryset = queryset1 | queryset2
    queryset = queryset1 & ~queryset2

(similar to ``Q`` objects)

Custom QuerySets
================

`Calling custom QuerySet methods from the manager <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/managers/#calling-custom-queryset-methods-from-the-manager>`_

`Creating a manager with QuerySet methodsÂ¶ <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/db/managers/#creating-a-manager-with-queryset-methods>`_::

    class Person(models.Model):
        ...
        people = PersonQuerySet.as_manager()


    class BaseManager(....):
        ....

    class MyModel(models.Model):
        objects = BaseManager.from_queryset(CustomQuerySet)()


Custom Lookups
==============

Adding to the kwargs you can pass to `filter` and `exclude` etc.
