.. index:: ! X11

X11 Window System
=================

Startup
-------

Looking around on Ubuntu

/etc/X11 is a good place to start

.. index:: X11; Xsession

`Xsession` is invoked by the display manager.

See 'man 5 Xsession'

Xsession redirects stdout & stderr to $HOME/.xsession-errors almost first thing

Xsession.d/* has a bunch of scripts that are sourced in order by Xsession:

  20x11-common_process-args: sets STARTUP if arg passed to Xsession
  40x11-common_xsessionrc: will source $HOME/.xsessionrc if it is readable
  50x11-common_determine-startup: will set STARTUP to ~/.xsession or ~/.Xsession but ONLY if the display manager has not already set a startup command by passing it to Xsession - or so the comments say...

Also look at /etc/kde4/kdm:

  kdmrc:  LOTS of useful config stuff - read the comments

Which directories kdm looks in for different desktop sessions -
It might just use the first of these where it finds anything??????

.. index:: X11; xessions

  /usr/share/xsessions
  /var/lib/menu-xdg/xsessions    (no such dir)
  /etc/kde4/kdm/sessions                (empty)
  /usr/share/kde4/apps/kdm/sessions   (a zillion files, I suspect it doesn't look here since others come first)
