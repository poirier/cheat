WORK IN PROGRESS: a Vue pattern for a component to edit the properties of some object
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is never going to be finished. I do not use Vue anymore.

.. contents::

Usage::

    <my-component value="instance" @save="onSave" @cancel="onCancel">

Minimal implementation::

    <template>
       <input v-model="workingValue.prop1">
       <input v-model="workingValue.prop2">

       <button type="button" @click="cancelClicked">Cancel</button>
       <button type="button" @click="saveClicked">Save</button>
    </template>

    <script>
    import _ from 'lodash'

    export default {
      name: 'MyComponent',
      data () {
        return {
          workingValue: _.cloneDeep(this.value)
        }
      },
      props: {
        value: {
          type: Object,
          required: true
        }
      },
      methods: {
        cancelClicked () {
          this.$emit('cancel')
        },
        saveClicked () {
          if (isValid(this.workingValue)) {
            this.$emit('save', this.workingValue)
          }
        }
      }
    }
    </script>

It is careful not to ever modify the value passed to it. The parent expects
that it can manage changes itself by using a computed property or watcher
if it wants.

The component emits events to tell the parent when the user has chosen to save their
changes, or cancel, but leaves it to the parent to do what it wants at that
point.

Example using the component::

    <template>
       <my-component
         v-if="userIsEditingObject"
         @save="onSave"
         @cancel="onCancel"
       />
     </template>

     <script>
     export default {
       methods: {
         onCancel () {
           this.userIsEditingObject = false
         },
         onSave (value) {
           this.$store.dispatch('save', value).then( () => {
               this.userIsEditingObject = false
           })
         }
     }
     </script>

Reactivity
----------

The following applies to the store's state, anything in a component's
*data*, and other things that get pulled into the reactivity system.

When an object is added to Vue's reactivity system, Vue replaces all
its properties with getters and setters under the covers, so that if
you fetch the value of a property, or assign a new value to it, Vue
is aware and can react. (`<https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html>`_)

However, for technical reasons, Vue cannot detect when a property is
added to or removed from an object.
(`<https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html#Change-Detection-Caveats>`_)

**The implications are:**

* When updating the store, it's fine to assign a new value to a property
  of the *state*.
* When updating component data, it's fine to assign a new value to a
  property of the component *data*.
* Don't try to use Object.assign or equivalent to update properties of
  objects in-place in the store????  It doesn't seem to work.

Component properties
--------------------

Vue doesn't necessarily rebuild a component from scratch when one of
its properties changes. If you're using a property to initialize something,
for example, you will need to `watch` that property and re-initialize when
it changes that way.

*However,* I'm not sure even watching a property works. I've seen components
updated when a watch on a property never triggered.

Vuex (the store)
----------------

Getters
.......

`Getters doc <https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/getters.html>`_

Getters provide computed values based on the state. Their
results are cached until the state they depend on changes.

Getters are accessed as *properties* not *methods*.

They are passed as a second arg an object with all the store's
getters, in case they want to use them.

::

    const store = new Vuex.Store({
        ...
        getters: {
            totalCost: (state, othergetters) => {
               return some_computation_on_state
            }

    // component...

    computed: {
        the_total_cost () {
            return store.getters.totalCost    // No parens, not called like a method
        }
    }

Mutations
.........

`Mutations doc <https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/mutations.html>`_

Mutations *must be synchronous*.

They cannot be called. They must be invoked using ``commit``.

They receive a state and optional arguments, and can change
the state.

When the state changes, other Vue components observing the
state will update automatically.

Any value returned by a mutation is *not* passed back to
the caller of ``commit``.

Actions
.......

`Actions doc <https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/actions.html>`_

Actions can contain asynchronous code.  They receive a ``context`` object
that has methods like ``commit`` and properties like
``state`` and ``getters``.

Actions cannot be called. They must be invoked using ``dispatch``.

Any value returned by an action is passed back to the
caller of ``dispatch``, by way of resolving the promise
that dispatch returns to that value.

Dispatching actions always returns Promises.

Example::

    const store = new Vuex.Store({
      state: {
        count: 0
      },
      mutations: {
        increment (state) {
          state.count++
        }
      },
      actions: {
        increment (context) {
            context.commit('increment')
        },
        checkout ({ commit, state }, products) {
            // save the items currently in the cart
            const savedCartItems = [...state.cart.added]
            // send out checkout request, and optimistically
            // clear the cart
            commit(types.CHECKOUT_REQUEST)
            // the shop API accepts a success callback and a failure callback
            shop.buyProducts(
              products,
              // handle success
              () => commit(types.CHECKOUT_SUCCESS),
              // handle failure
              () => commit(types.CHECKOUT_FAILURE, savedCartItems)
            )
        },
        async actionA ({ commit }) {
            commit('gotData', await getData())
        },
        async actionB ({ dispatch, commit }) {
            await dispatch('actionA') // wait for `actionA` to finish
            commit('gotOtherData', await getOtherData())
        }
      }
    })

Custom components implementing v-model
--------------------------------------

Vue handles the heavy lifting when a component is
included somewhere with a v-model attribute. All your
component needs to do is accept a "value" property,
and emit an "input" event when the value changes,
with the new value.

Possibly surprising things in Vue
=================================

The Vue documentation tells you how almost everything in Vue works,
but you really need to know more than that to use Vue. I like
the analogy that knowing how to drive nails and saw boards
doesn't enable you to build a house, especially not a house
that won't fall down.

Here are some things I've discovered through experience, or
that were mentioned in the documentation but I've found to be
more important than I would have guessed.

.vue files
----------

* You can start your ``.vue`` file with a big multiline ``<!-- ...  -->``
  comment to document it.

Templates
---------

* A component must end up rendering either zero or one HTML
  element. It may, of course, have lots of stuff nested inside.
  The real surprise to me was that it can render to no
  element at all.

* You can use both ``:class`` and ``class`` on the same element.
  The resulting classes will be merged.

* When using 'v-if', 'v-else', 'v-else-if' in templates, give each
  element using them a unique key, just as if they were using
  'v-for'.

* "control-flow" features like 'v-if' and 'v-for' can only be used
  as attributes on HTML elements. But if you really don't want an
  HTML element there, you can put them on the pseudo-element
  ``<template>``.

* ``v-model`` should never refer directly to things in the store, because
  it'll try to change values without going through mutations.
  Using a computed property with a setter handles this nicely.

.. note:: Wouldn't it be nice if Vue did "the right thing" in this case?
    But I guess it can't know that, say, a Javscript object string is
    a property of something else that is reactive.

* ``v-model`` can refer to properties inside a computed property
  (e.g. ``v-model="prop1.subprop"``) where ``prop`` is a computed
  property.

.. warning:: But I haven't tested that the setter gets invoked when prop.subprop is changed, or does v-model just update the object in place. I'd guess the latter.

* If you need to access something from a template that isn't already
  part of the component's data or methods, just import it and stick
  it into ``.data``.  E.g.::

      import { utilMethod } from '@/utils'
      export default {
        data () {
          return {
            a: 1,
            utilMethod
          }
        }
      }

  Or maybe methods would be better stuck into ``methods``?

* When using ``v-for``, if there's anything in the list you're going
  to iterate over that you don't want to include, then use a computed
  property, or a method, to filter the list down to just the items you do
  want to include, then iterate over that using ``v-for``.
  (Do not try to use ``v-for`` and ``v-if`` on the same element.)

Component code
--------------

* You can use `ref <https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#ref>`_ to get access
  in component code to the DOM.  Or ``this.$el``.

* Give every component a ``name``. It'll make output in the
  browser console more useful, and is required when nesting
  components recursively.

* The vue docs make a point of saying that properties
  are a `one-way flow <https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#One-Way-Data-Flow>`_
  of information into components.

* To get information back out of a component, you can use:

  * events
  * the store
  * ``v-model``

Reactivity
----------

I get myself confused with two different things that I'm
lumping together as "reactivity":

1) Vue "knowing" when a piece of data changes so it can take action.

2) The actions Vue takes when it detects such changes.

It helps me to have a mental model of how Vue is implementing something
like this. Here's my mental model for reactivity.  (I do *not* know for
sure that this is accurate - I might need to set up some tests to validate
these points.)

* The way Vue can "watch" something is to set up its *properties* with
  proxy getters and setters.  This is how it watches ``vm.data`` and the
  store's ``state``, for example.

* For each property, it starts an "on change" list of things it needs to do
  if the property's value changes.

* Each time a watched property's `setter` is invoked, Vue looks over its "on change" list
  and executes each item.

* Vue also arranges to know when watched properties are accessed, but it doesn't
  pay attention to that all the time, only during certain activities:

  * while computing a computed property
  * while rendering a component (?)

  During those times, for each watched property that is accessed, Vue
  adds an action to that watched property's "on change" list to re-compute the thing
  it was computing when it accessed it previously.

* Any `watch property handlers <https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/computed.html#Watchers>`_
  are added to the corresponding "on change" list for the watched data.

  You *can* add properties here. E.g.
  if ``patient`` is part of the data, adding a watcher on ``patient.email`` will
  trigger when ``patient.email`` changes.

Which data does Vue "watch"?

1) The
   `data <https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html#Data-and-Methods>`_
   on a component. When a component is created, Vue sets
   up proxy getters and setters for each property of its `data`, so
   that if anything is assigned, Vue gets invoked and knows things
   have changed. It also knows when things are accessed.

   Per the page linked just above, Vue will re-render the view when
   *any* property in the components `data` is changed.

2) Computed properties - at least, computed properties are included
   when Vue is paying attention to which watched data is being
   accessed. (If a computed property has a `set()`, that doesn't actually
   do anything special, though of course it might make changes to
   other things that Vue is watching.)

3) The state in the store.
   `"Since a Vuex store's state is made reactive by Vue, when we mutate the
   state, Vue components observing the state will update
   automatically." <https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/mutations.html#mutations-follow-vue-s-reactivity-rules>`_


*watching props* - this does not seem to work? I put a 'watch' on
a prop that was being changed, and could see the component was updating,
but the watch did not trigger.

Computed properties
-------------------

* Computed properties can have
  `getters and setters <https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/computed.html#Computed-Setter>`_
  which makes them a *lot* more useful.  A common pattern is
  for get() to get a value from the store and set() to update
  the store.

* ``v-model`` and a computed property work very well together.

The store
---------

* Dispatching an action always returns a promise, whether you wrote code in the
  action method to do that or not. Of course, if you do return a
  promise, it'll be returned to the caller. But this does mean
  that every time you dispatch an action, you can (and must) assume it's
  going to run asynchronously and code appropriately.

* It's often a good idea to resist putting things into the store
  unless you have to. It is, essentially, a big global
  variable.  Some reasons I think you might reasonably put things
  into the store:

  * you'd otherwise need to pass data as properties down into
    multiply nested components
  * you need to share data among components that are only
    distantly related

  Note that you can still model access to data in your backend by
  using store actions, but even then, you don't necessarily have to save a
  copy of the data in the store.

What's the advantage of using the store?

* When you `commit` a change, Vue knows that part of the state has
  changed and can propagate that change to all the parts of the app
  that are depending on it. (more "reactivity")

* Because the `dispatch` interface to actions is asynchronous, if the
  rest of the app accesses the store via actions, then you can change
  to having the data in a backend and using an API to access it without
  having to change the rest of the app. Just update the actions to use
  the API instead of looking in the store. The rest of the app is already
  written to access things asynchronously.

More on reactivity
------------------

"watching" things
.................

I didn't notice right away that the "watch" feature of Vue components
is cleverly defined so that you can only watch properties of your
component -- it is *not* a general-purpose "watch anything for changes"
function.  So you can watch `data`, or `computed` properties. And
that's about it, right? ANSWER THIS QUESTION.
